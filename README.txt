What I did for this project:

1. Dynamically create the form element depending upon the answer to the last question using <select><option>elements. 

2. I create 3 different questions and has 2 choices for each question

3. After user did the last choice and click submit, the option they make will store in the Local Storage and print out everything store in the Local Storage.

4. The topic I choose is Mamamoo, they are k-pop girl group from South-Korean. In this project, you can choose to listen the solo music from each member and submit which one you like the most.

5. user can start over at any time by change the option or they can click the submit button to submit the answer. 

6. If there are any choice or input didn't make when click the submit button, it will pop up the window for the error message and let user to start all over again. 

7. clear button to clear the data in local storage and restart. 

8. name the main page index.html

9. Within the <body> of the HTML page all HTML are created dynamically.

10. Professional looking

11. Didn't post this on the internet

12. Didn't use innerHTML, innerText, etc.

13. Once 3+ select options are showing, changing the 2nd or 1st will remove all those selections below the changed one, except for the next item allowing a new selection.

14. Separate file for data, formatted. Allows for changing data files and program still works  At least 2 choices for each selection.

15. I separate the code in files: JS,CSS,HTML,data.

16. create some DHTML elements.

17. I use google chrome to test my project. In my friend computer the buttons are disappear in her google chrome, but it work fine with the Firefox. I don't know what reason, but it work fine with my computer for both web browse. If the button disappear when you test it, you can try to use the Firefox to test. 


Extra:

1. The DHTML I use for this project is to create the sideshow using the setInterval function in java script. After user making the choice of the member, it will pop up the members image by slideshow.

2. After member did the last choice which is the music they want to hear, it will change the image slideshow to the music video. User can control when to start the video and stop or replay at any time. 

3. Each select user making will display the different image slideshow or music video. 

4. I use the alert function pop the error message when user didn't input their name or make a selection.
